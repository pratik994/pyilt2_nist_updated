# Updated version of **pyILT2**
## Updated by Kan Hatakeyama (2022/9/30)
    - v0.9.8 to v1.0.0
    - Fix bug of property search
    - Update information is available on the bottom of this page

# Update by Pratik Dhakal (10/25/2022)
 - Fixed the pyilt2 report issue "Error : Lower consolute temperature‚Äù
 - The error was caused by the addition of new properties such as "Lower consolute temperature" to the NIST IL thermo database
 - The pyilt2 property dictionary had an issue when it encountered the new property name as it had no such property in its own database
 - Simple fix by adding new properties name to the pyilt2 property dictionary

List of properties available in NIST IL thermo can be accessed from here

 # Modified existing property name to match the NIST IL thermo database
 
 - ~~Self-diffusion coefficient~~   'Self diffusion coefficient'
