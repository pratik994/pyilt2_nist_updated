# Update by Pratik Dhakal (10/25/2022)
 - Fixed the pyilt2 report issue "Error : Lower consolute temperature‚Äù
 - The error was caused by the addition of new properties such as "Lower consolute temperature" to the NIST IL thermo database
 - The pyilt2 property dictionary had an issue when it encountered the new property name as it had no such property in its own database
 - Simple fix by adding new properties name to the pyilt2 property dictionary
